According to Ayurveda, the healthiness of raw versus cooked food depends on individual factors such as digestive capacity, constitution, and current state of balance. Raw foods may have more purging qualities and can be beneficial for Kapha and Pitta types, while cooked foods are generally easier to digest and can increase nutrient bioavailability. However, long-term use of raw food can cause serious issues for Vata-dominant individuals. The optimal diet varies based on an individual's unique constitution, current imbalances, age, season, and climate. Ayurveda generally recommends a balance of both raw and cooked foods, with an emphasis on what is easiest for the individual to digest and maintain overall health. See the recipe section for more details.
