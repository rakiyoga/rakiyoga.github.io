**Relevant legal bases**

In the following we inform you about the legal basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), on the basis of which we process the personal data. Please note that in addition to the regulations of the GDPR, the national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence and domicile may apply.

Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR) – The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.

Fulfillment of contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b. GDPR) – The processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract to which the data subject is party, or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures that are required at the request of the data subject take place.

Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f. GDPR) – Processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible or a third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which protect personal Data require prevail.

National data protection regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the law on the protection against misuse of personal data in data processing (Federal Data Protection Act – BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

**Safety measures**

We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability and their separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.

**Shortening of the IP address**: If it is possible for us or if it is not necessary to save the IP address, we will shorten your IP address or have it shortened. If the IP address is shortened, also referred to as “IP masking”, the last octet, i.e. the last two digits of an IP address, is deleted (in this context, the IP address is an Internet connection through the online access provider individually assigned identifier). The purpose of shortening the IP address is to prevent or make it much more difficult to identify a person based on their IP address.

SSL encryption (https): In order to protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.

**Transfer and Disclosure of Personal Data**

As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons or that it is disclosed to them. The recipients of this data can include, for example, payment institutions in the context of payment transactions, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such a case, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.

**Use of cookies**

“Cookies” are small files that are stored on users’ devices. Different information can be stored by means of cookies. The information can include, for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a shopping cart or the place where a video was watched.

As a rule, cookies are also used when the interests of a user or his behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using functions, etc.) are stored in a user profile on individual websites. Such profiles are used to show users, for example, content that corresponds to their potential interests. This process is also referred to as “tracking”, i.e. tracking the potential interests of users. The term cookies also includes other technologies that fulfill the same functions as cookies (e.g. when user information is stored using pseudonymous online identifiers, also referred to as “user IDs”).

If we use cookies or “tracking” technologies, we will inform you separately in our data protection declaration.

**Notes on legal bases**: The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask for your consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offer and its improvement) or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.

**Revocation and objection (opt-out)**: Regardless of whether the processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the option at any time to revoke your consent or to object to the processing of your data by cookie technologies (collectively as ” referred to as “opt-out”).

You can initially declare your objection using the settings in your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (which can also limit the functionality of our online offer).

An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can be raised using a variety of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US site http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or the EU site http: //www.youronlinechoices.com/ or generally at http://optout.aboutads.info.

**Types of data processed**: usage data (websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (device information, IP addresses).

Affected persons: users (website visitors, users of online services).

Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

**Blogs and publication media**

We use blogs or comparable means of online communication and publication (hereinafter “publication medium”). The data of the readers are processed for the purposes of the publication medium only insofar as it is necessary for its presentation and the communication between authors and readers or for reasons of security. In addition, we refer to the information on the processing of visitors to our publication medium in the context of this data protection notice.

**Retrieving WordPress emojis and smilies**: Graphic emojis (or smilies), i.e. small graphic files that express feelings, are used within our WordPress blog for the purpose of efficiently integrating content elements, obtained from external servers. The server providers collect the IP addresses of the users. This is necessary so that the emoji files can be transmitted to the users’ browsers.

Types of data processed: Inventory data (names, addresses, etc.), contact data (e-mail, telephone numbers), content data (text input, photographs, videos), usage data (websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (device information, IP addresses), contract data (subject of the contract, term, customer category).

**Contact**

When contacting us (e.g. via contact form, e-mail, telephone or via social media), the details of the requesting person will be processed to the extent that this is necessary to answer the contact request and any requested measures.

The answering of contact inquiries within the framework of contractual or pre-contractual relationships takes place to fulfill our contractual obligations or to answer (pre)contractual inquiries and otherwise on the basis of the legitimate interests in answering the inquiries.

**Types of data processed**: Inventory data (names, addresses, etc.), contact data (e-mail, telephone numbers), content data (text entries, photographs, videos).

Affected persons: communication partners.

Purposes of processing: contact requests and communication.

Legal basis: Performance of contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b. GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

**Web Analysis and Optimization**

The web analysis (also referred to as “reach measurement”) serves to evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offer and can include behavior, interests or demographic information about the visitors, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of the range analysis, we can, for example, recognize at what time our online offer or its functions or content are used most frequently or invite you to reuse them. We can also understand which areas need optimization.

In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures, e.g. to test and optimize different versions of our online offer or its components.

For these purposes, so-called user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called “cookie”) or similar processes can be used for the same purpose. This information can include, for example, content viewed, websites visited and elements used there and technical information such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this can also be processed depending on the provider.

The IP addresses of the users are also saved. However, we use an IP masking process (i.e. pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear user data (e.g. e-mail addresses or names) are stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and optimization, but pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes of the respective process.

**Notes on legal bases**: If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this data protection declaration.

Affected persons: users (website visitors, users of online services).

**Purposes of processing**: range measurement (access statistics, recognition of returning visitors), tracking (interest/behaviour-related profiling, cookies), visit action evaluation, profiling (creating user profiles).

Security measures: IP masking (pseudonymization of the IP address).

**Legal basis**: Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a GDPR), legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

**Presences in social networks**

We maintain online presences within social networks in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us there.

We would like to point out that user data can be processed outside of the European Union. This can result in risks for users, for example because it could make it more difficult to enforce user rights. With regard to US providers who are certified under the Privacy Shield or offer comparable guarantees of a secure level of data protection, we would like to point out, that they undertake to comply with the data protection standards of the EU.

Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on usage behavior and the resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users’ computers, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them).

For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the possibility of objection (opt-out), we refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

Also in the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the users and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.

**Types of data processed**: Inventory data (names, addresses, etc.), contact data (e-mail, telephone numbers), content data (text input, photographs, videos), usage data (websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (device information, IP addresses).

Affected persons: users (website visitors, users of online services).

Purposes of processing: contact requests and communication, tracking (interest/behavioral profiling, cookies), remarketing.

**Legal basis**: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

Services and service providers used:

**Instagram**: social network; Service Provider: Instagram Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Website: https://www.instagram.com; Privacy Policy: http://instagram.com/about/legal/privacy.

Plugins and embedded functions and content

We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as “third-party providers”). This can be, for example, graphics, videos or social media buttons as well as posts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).

The integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content or functions. We endeavor to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information can also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and the operating system, websites to be referred to, the time of the visit and other information on the use of our online offer and can also be linked to such information from other sources.

**Notes on legal bases**: If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this data protection declaration.

Types of data processed: usage data (websites visited, interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (device information, IP addresses).

Affected persons: users (website visitors, users of online services).

Purposes of processing: Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness, contractual services and services.

Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f. GDPR).

**Deletion of data**

The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as your consent to processing is revoked or other permissions are no longer applicable (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data no longer applies or it is not required for the purpose).

If the data is not deleted because it is required for other, legally permissible purposes, its processing will be limited to these purposes. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.

Further information on the deletion of personal data can also be provided in the context of the individual data protection information in this data protection declaration.

We ask you to inform yourself regularly about the content of our data protection declaration. We will adapt the data protection declaration as soon as the changes in the data processing we carry out make this necessary. We will inform you as soon as the changes require your participation (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.

**Rights of data subjects to whom it might concern**

**Right of objections**: You have the right, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at any time to the processing of your personal data, which is based on Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. e or f GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If the personal data, concerning you, is processed in order to operate direct advertising, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data, for the purpose of such advertising; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated with such direct advertising.

**Right of withdrawal for consent**: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.

**Right to information**: You have the right to request confirmation as to whether the data in question is being processed and to request information about this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.

**Right to rectification**: In accordance with legal requirements, you have the right to request the completion of the data concerning you or the correction of incorrect data concerning you.

**Right to erasure and restriction of processing**: In accordance with the legal requirements, you have the right to request that the data concerning you be deleted immediately, or alternatively to request a restriction of the processing of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.

**Complaint to the supervisory authority**: You also have the right, in accordance with the legal requirements, to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority.

**Definitions of terms**

This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this data protection declaration. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined above all in Art. 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are intended primarily for understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.

**Visit action evaluation**: “Visit action evaluation” (English “Conversion Tracking”) refers to a procedure with which the effectiveness of marketing measures can be determined. For this purpose, a cookie is usually stored on the user’s devices within the websites on which the marketing measures take place and then accessed again on the target website (e.g. we can understand whether the ads placed by us on other websites were successful)

**IP masking**: “IP masking” is a method in which the last octet, i.e. the last two digits of an IP address, are deleted so that the IP address can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person. Therefore, IP masking is a means of pseudonymizing processing methods, especially in online marketing.

**Profiling**: “Profiling” means any type of automated processing of personal data, which consists in using this personal data to record certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include information relating to the Age, gender, location data and movement data, interaction with websites and their content, shopping behavior, social interactions with other people), to analyze, evaluate or predict them (e.g. interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a website or the place of residence). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.

**Range measurement**: The range measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offer and can include the behavior or interests of visitors in certain information, such as website content. With the help of the range analysis, website owners can, for example, see at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This allows them, for example, to better optimize the content of the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used for range analysis purposes in order to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyzes of the use of an online offer.

**Remarketing**: One speaks of “remarketing” or “retargeting” when, for advertising purposes, for example, it is noted which products a user was interested in on a website in order to remind the user of these products on other websites, e.g. in advertisements .

**Tracking**: One speaks of “tracking” when the behavior of users can be traced across several online offers. As a rule, behavioral and interest information is stored in cookies or on the servers of the tracking technology providers with regard to the online offers used (so-called profiling). This information can then be used, for example, to show users advertisements that presumably correspond to their interests.

**Processing**: “Processing” is any operation or series of operations carried out with or without the aid of automated procedures in connection with personal data. The term goes far and covers practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or deletion.

**Use of Google analytics**

This website uses the web analysis service software Google analytics ([Google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)), a service provided by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand, (“Google analytics”) on the basis of our legitimate interest in statistical analysis of user behavior for optimization and marketing purposes in accordance with Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR data is collected and stored. Pseudonymised usage profiles can be created and evaluated from this data for the same purpose. Cookies can be used. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache of the website visitor’s Internet browser. The cookies enable, among other things, the recognition of the Internet browser. The data collected using Google analytics technology (including your pseudonymised IP address) is processed on our servers. . The information generated by the cookie in the pseudonymous user profile is not used to personally identify the visitor to this website and is not combined with personal data about the bearer of the pseudonym. If you do not agree to the storage and evaluation of this data from your visit, you can object to the storage and use at any time with a mouse click. In this case, a so-called opt-out cookie is stored in your browser, which means that Google analytics does not collect any session data. Please note that if you completely delete your cookies, the opt-out cookie will also be deleted and you may have to reactivate it.
