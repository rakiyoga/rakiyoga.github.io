- Vata-Focused Sessions: If you're battling restlessness, irregular sleep, or digestive ups and downs, this is for you.

**Our Consultation Process**
During your visit, we'll dive deep into understanding your prakriti (innate nature) and current state of health. This involves:
A thorough chat about your health history and concerns
Tongue analysis
A look at your overall appearance and energy
Based on these insights, we'll craft a wellness plan that fits seamlessly into your life, including dietary tweaks, lifestyle adjustments, and herbal support.
