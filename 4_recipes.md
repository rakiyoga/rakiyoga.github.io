<summary>Anti allergic soup</summary>

This soup recipe is to modulate your immunity and balance your doshas. Stinging nettle / Brennnesseln (Urtica dioica) has anti-allergic, antihistamine, anti-inflammatory, and sinus-clearing properties when combined with other herbs. It provides first aid for allergic rhinitis and seasonal allergies. Nettle increases ojas (vitality) and acts as a nourishing tonic, especially for the kidneys and adrenals. It reduces excess pitta (heat) in the blood and lymph, helping to clear inflammatory skin conditions.

<summary>Bärlauch Pesto</summary>

Ayurveda aligns its new year with the arrival of a new season, typically spring. During this time, the plants that naturally emerge help to reduce the accumulated Kapha from the previous winter season.
A prime example of such a spring plant is wild garlic, also known as Bärlauch or Wunderlauch (Allium ursinum & Allium paradoxum). To make a delicious wild garlic pesto, combine 200g of the fresh buds with 50ml of pomegranate vinegar, 200g of roasted almond nuts, and 500ml of olive oil.
This pesto can be stored for up to 3 years, provided no water droplets get inside the container. The vinegar and oil help preserve the pesto, making it a versatile condiment to enjoy throughout the year.
