According to Ayurvedic principles, different cooking vessels are considered more suitable for preparing certain types of foods. When choosing cooking vessels in Ayurveda, it's important to consider the type of food being prepared, the cooking method, and your individual dosha balance. It's also recommended to use a variety of cooking vessels to benefit from their different properties and avoid overexposure to any single material.

**Clay pot** cooking releases essential micronutrients from the clay into the food during the cooking process. This method not only cooks the food thoroughly but also transforms these micronutrients into a more bioavailable form, which is not achievable in their raw state. In contrast, pressure cooking can destroy up to 87% of micronutrients due to the intense pressure, which breaks down food molecules rather than cooking them properly. This results in food that appears cooked but is often undercooked nutritionally. Clay pots preserve micronutrients by allowing gentle, slow cooking that retains the natural juices and nutrients of the ingredients. The porous nature of clay allows for even heat distribution and moisture circulation, which helps preserve vitamins and minerals that are often lost in high-temperature cooking methods.

**Iron cookware** enhances the iron content of leafy green vegetables through a process called iron leaching. When acidic foods or liquids come into contact with the iron surface, small amounts of iron are released into the food. This is especially beneficial when cooking leafy greens, as it can increase their iron content, making them more nutritious. Iron cookware is recommended for period pain and anemia due to its ability to increase the iron content of food, particularly leafy greens. 
The increased iron in the food can then be absorbed by the body, helping to alleviate iron deficiency anemia and related symptoms like period pain. The scientific basis for this is the reactivity of iron with acidic compounds, which allows the iron to be released from the cookware and incorporated into the food.

Below is the short summary of different vessels and thier tridoshic qualitiies:

| Silver| Cooling effect (for serving)		      | Balances Pitta         | 
| Brass	| Cooling effect, water storage	      	| Balances Pitta         |
