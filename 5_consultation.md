**Example of personalized care for your dosha**
Every individual is a unique blend of the three doshas - Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. At Roots & Rhythms, we don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. Our consultations are carefully crafted to address your specific dosha dominance:
- **Vata**-Focused Sessions: If you're battling restlessness, irregular sleep, or digestive ups and downs, this is for you.
- **Pitta**-Balancing Consultations: Designed for those grappling with inflammation, skin flare-ups, or feeling constantly on edge.
- **Kapha**-Harmonizing Appointments: Perfect if you're looking to boost metabolism, shake off lethargy, or improve respiratory health.
