Incompatible diet and food combinations is one of the common cause of diseases as per Ayurveda. For example milk and salt are enemy to each other. Putting salt in yogurt also kill the probiotics and also causing the skin related problems. Also adding salad/fruits/flavors in yogurt is common in many culture, which does not mean at all that it is healthy just because of long or ancient practice.
In Ayurveda, **Viruddha Ahara** refers to incompatible foods or food combinations that can disturb the balance of the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), impair digestion (Agni), and lead to the production of toxins (Ama) in the body. These food combinations are believed to have a negative impact on health and can cause various diseases if consumed regularly.

Here is a comprehensive table listing some examples of Viruddha Ahara (incompatible foods) as per Ayurveda:
