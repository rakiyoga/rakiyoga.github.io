**Sprouts & Raw foods** are ideal for breakfast from late spring to summer's end, especially for Pitta person. Those with weaker agni (digestive fire) can enhance digestibility with fresh ginger, black pepper, or long pepper.

**Bärlauch Pesto**
Ayurveda aligns its new year with the arrival of a new season, typically spring. During this time, the plants that naturally emerge help to reduce the accumulated Kapha from the previous winter season.
A prime example of such a spring plant is wild garlic, also known as Bärlauch or Wunderlauch (Allium ursinum & Allium paradoxum). To make a delicious wild garlic pesto, combine 200g of the fresh buds with 50ml of pomegranate vinegar, 200g of roasted almond nuts, and 500ml of olive oil.
This pesto can be stored for up to 3 years, provided no water droplets get inside the container. The vinegar and oil help preserve the pesto, making it a versatile condiment to enjoy throughout the year.
